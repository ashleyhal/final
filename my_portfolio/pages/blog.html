	  <h1>The Importance of CTE</h1>
	  <p><img src="../images/code.jpg" width="250" height="167" alt=""/><span style="font-family: Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', 'DejaVu Serif', Georgia, serif; font-size: 16px; color: #5D578A;">As the technological world</span> changes, students need to become more prepared for the future. Gaining a CTE education helps this preparation. CTE stands for Career and Technical Education. With schools that have CTE programs, their students become more equipped for the world in front of them. I have the opportunity to attend a school with a CTE program. Through this program, I have access to various professional certification classes such as Adobe Web Design and Adobe Visual Design. Through this class I have been able to gain certifications in Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe Dreamweaver. Many people have asked me about if I recommend CTE programs and are always shocked when they hear about my ability to gain professional certifications. I will always recommend classes like these. </p>

	  <h1>My Experience with Adobe</h1>
	  <p><img src="../images/design.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="166" class="floatLeft"/><span style="font-family: Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', 'DejaVu Serif', Georgia, serif; font-size: 16px; color: #5D578A;">I was hesitant</span> to join my schoolâ€™s Academy of Informational Technology because I was unsure if I would enjoy it. But two years into my high school career, and I love it. With my Adobe design classes, I learn important skills in computers and project management. I learned the importance of proper teamwork and how to handle strict deadlines. I am so grateful for the ability to learn and become certified in Adobe softwares, and am so glad that I decided to join the AOIT.

	  <h1>Using Technology to Connect</h1>
	  <p><img src="../images/students.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="166" class="floatRight"/><span style="font-family: Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', 'DejaVu Serif', Georgia, serif; font-size: 16px; color: #5D578A;">When the COVID-19 pandemic</span> hit, I was in the middle of my seventh grade year. We were unsure of what the future would hold. We had to adapt to the situation quickly. But with the use of technology, we were all able to connect with each other. The use of technology has been rapidly increasing, and we must prepare ourselves to be equipped with the changes. By taking more technology-focused classes, students become more prepared for their future.
